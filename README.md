RestaurantListings is simple restaurant viewer app. The functionality is quite simple: Fetch the list of available restaurants from the API and display them to the user. The user should be able to search the restaurants with a variety of filters. A basic boilerplate has been provided for the app which consists of two main components:

RestaurantListings - The AspNetCore backend
RestaurantListings.UI - The React frontend
The application can be started by running the main RestaurantListings

dotnet run -p ./RestaurantListings
This will start both the API and React frontend. A Swagger/OpenAPI UI is available on https://localhost:5001/swagger.

Requirements
The initial implementation has been already been completed; but it's ugly, buggy and uses a variety of bad practices. Refactor the app to meet the following requirements:

The user is presented with a list of restaurants:

The list should show the image, title, description, and other basic info
The list should use semantically sound HTML and modern CSS practices
Make use of your choice of styling systems (CSS-in-JS, SASS, CSS, etc)
BONUS: Make the layout responsive
BONUS: Lazy load the restaurants page
The user should be able to filter restaurants efficiently and consistently via a number of options:

Through the tags:

which should be displayed alphabetically
Multiple tags can be selected at a time
No duplicate tags should be shown
Through the family friendly and vegan options, which should check the relevant flags on the restaurant
Add two or more of the following features:

Add a search bar to the filters to allow users to search through the restaurants.

Add the ability for signed in users to create a new restaurant:

New restaurants can be created by sending a POST request to the /api/restaurants endpoint. It accepts the following restaurant properties: name, description, phoneNumber, address, veganFriendly, familyFriendly with name, phoneNumber, and address being required.
The form should have basic error handling and validation.
Add basic rating functionality to the API and frontend:

Only signed in users should be able to rate a restaurant
The rating should only be between 1 and 5
Recalculate the average restaurant rating when a new rating is applied
Display the average restaurant rating on the restaurant list
Only one rating per user per restaurant should be allowed, but they are allowed to change their rating
